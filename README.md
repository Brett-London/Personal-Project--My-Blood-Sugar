# Personal-Project--My-Blood-Sugar
Data from my own blood glucose results pulled from a Dexcom G7
- 🩸I am a type 1 diabetic. I monitor my blood sugar everyday using a Dexcom G7. 
- 📝Every 5 minutes, my Dexcom G7 updates with a new glucose reading. 
- 📆The Data consists of 90 days of my blood glucose results, which gave me 25,685 glucose readings. 5/19/23 - 8/16/23
- 📈With the data, I pulled it into a Excel where I created functions to help categorize my results. Functions such as IFS and AverageIFS were used. A XLookup function was used aswell. 
- 📊With the data cleaned and the necessary fucntions created to help enchance my understanding of my results, I created vizulizations to help me understand trends in my blood glucose. 
- 📬 I have now made 2 different dashboards in Tableau. These dashboards consist of many differnt visuals to help get a picture on my glucose levels. These visuals consist of line charts, bar charts, stacked bar charts, and many more.
- 🧠 Now that I have uploaded this data to Tableau and made visuals and dashboards, I am going to upload this the data too Power BI to create more visuals and build a even more visually enchancing story on my glucose results.
