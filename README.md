# Personal Project: My Blood Sugar
This project involves analyzing my blood glucose data collected from a Dexcom G7, a continuous glucose monitoring system. As a type 1 diabetic, I closely monitor my blood sugar levels to maintain optimal health and manage my condition effectively.

## 🩸 Personal Context
I am a type 1 diabetic and rely on my Dexcom G7 to provide real-time glucose readings throughout the day. This technology allows me to track fluctuations in my blood sugar, which is crucial for managing my diabetes.

## 📝 Data Collection
The Dexcom G7 updates my glucose readings every 5 minutes, providing a comprehensive view of my blood sugar levels. Over a 90-day period from May 19, 2023, to August 16, 2023, I accumulated a total of 25,685 glucose readings. This extensive dataset allows for detailed analysis and trend identification.

## 📈 Data Processing in Excel
I imported the collected data into Excel, where I utilized various functions to categorize and analyze my results. I employed IFS and AverageIFS functions to calculate averages and categorize my glucose levels based on specific criteria. Additionally, I used the XLOOKUP function to facilitate more dynamic data retrieval and enhance my analysis.

## 📊 Data Visualization
After cleaning the data and applying the necessary functions, I created visualizations to help me identify trends in my blood glucose levels. These visual representations are essential for understanding patterns over time and can inform my daily management strategies.

## 📬 Dashboards in Tableau
I developed two interactive dashboards in Tableau, which showcase a variety of visuals designed to give a comprehensive overview of my glucose levels. These dashboards include line charts to track changes over time, bar charts to compare daily averages, stacked bar charts to represent fluctuations, and other visuals that provide insight into my blood sugar management.

Through this project, I not only improved my data analysis and visualization skills but also gained a deeper understanding of my health metrics. The insights gathered from these dashboards help me make informed decisions about my diet, exercise, and insulin management, ultimately contributing to better control of my diabetes.
